# HoriseonCodeRefactor

### Homework 01

The goal here was to take an exsisting "code base" of CSS and HTML and refactor it,
replacing divs with semantic HTML elements, adding alts to img tags for accessibility,
and refactoring classes and CSS so it is not repeating itself.

Please see index.html and style.css for my refactored code.
